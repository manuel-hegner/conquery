## Glossary

Depending on the use-case, we're still calling the same concepts differently sometimes. Here is an explanation.

- **Concept Tree** – consists of concepts
- **Concept Tree Node / Concept** – a concept node
- **Query**
  - consisting of multiple `and`-groups
  - which again consist of multiple `or`-ed concepts
  - which again are applied on different tables
  - which again may contain certain filters for table columns
- **Query Editor** – on the right, used to construct a query interactively
- **Query And Group / Group** – column in the query editor
- **Query Node / Element** – one node in the query editor, either a concept or a previous query
- **Previous Query / Stored Query** – a previous query that has been saved in the backend database for future use (as itself or within other queries)
- **Dataset / Database** – data set that is used to ask queries against
- **Tooltip** – small area (below), that contains additional information on hovering over certain elements
- **Additional Infos** – data (key-value pairs) that are part of concept nodes and can be displayed inside the tooltip

## Various technical explanations

### Drag and Drop

- We're using MultiBackend to support Drag and Drop for touch and html5.
- To render a Drag and Drop preview on mobile, we'll have to calculate `width` and `height` of the drag source.
